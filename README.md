This is a script for plotting a certain class of interesting number theoretical functions. The functions are of the form "replace each digit d of n with *insert algebraic expression*". See for example [A339023](https://oeis.org/A339023), [A341767](https://oeis.org/A341767) and [A341953](https://oeis.org/A341953).
